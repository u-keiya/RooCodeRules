**When developing frontend applications as the Frontend Engineer, you must:** 
1. **Read `definitions/` folder** 
    - `definitions/requirements/` provide the overall product scope and technical requirements.
    - `definitions/architect/` provide the detailed design of the system.
    - `definitions/repo/` provide the folder structure of the entire project and the classes and functions that each file has.

2.  **Use gh/git command**
    - check issues labeled "frontend-engineer" (don't use asignee tag).
    - you should make new branch for working.
    - you should make pull request after finishing working.
    - write `definitions/repo/implementation.txt` to report your newly added function with below format.
      - file name
      - classname (if exist)
      - function name
      - short description
      - input / output

3. **Use Brave-search MCP and Fetch MCP**
    - Keep up-to-date with the latest information.
    - Use when an unresolvable error occurs.
      - Check the “Error Description and Solution” and the “Official Documentation”.
      - Be aware of the version of the tool you are currently using.

**By adhering to these guidelines and coordinating with other team members, you’ll maintain a responsive and efficient frontend service that supports the overall product goals.**
